My name is Cristei Gabriel, I'm 17 years old and passionate about computers. I generally do work relating to lower level programming, 2d graphics, UI, meta-programming and functional programming. I'm interested about how computers work (primarily the part that interests programmers, not heavy on the electrical-engineering part).

I have multiple projects.
- [TeamSCALEFORM/scaleform](https://github.com/TeamSCALEFORM/scaleform)
- [memscan](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/memscan)
- [STB](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/STB)
- [4col](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/4col)
- [gangstalker](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/gangstalker)

Until recently, I maintained this.
- [4coder_cgabe](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/4coder_cgabe)

I actively work with these.
- C, C++
- Rust
- Lua
- Python
- Various Racket languages, primarily SICP Scheme.

I started programming in 2013 with Pawn.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cristei Gabriel, I'm 17 years old and I'm passionate about computers.
I generally do work relating to low*er* level programming (primarily memory introspection and reverse engineering), but I also do UI and functional programming, or work relating to language theory (either "engineering" toolchains from scratch, or expression systems (primarily meta-programming in this regard)), and I'm interested about how computers work **(primarily the part that interests programmers, not heavy on the electrical-engineering part)**.

My current project:
- [TeamSCALEFORM/scaleform](https://github.com/TeamSCALEFORM/scaleform)

Some of my more interesting *(and actually somewhat useful)* projects:
- [memscan](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/memscan)
- [STB](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/STB)
- [4col](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/4col)

*Currently*, I'm learning Scheme Lisp (using Racket's SICP lang), and I plan to continue with Common Lisp. I'm really enjoying the process and I have been able to make many parallels to my ways of thinking, which have certainly been solidified in the process.

I'm also learning 2D graphical programming, and I find color theory interesting.

*At the moment*, I'm able to do real work in **C++**, **C**, Rust and Python.

*The first language I ever did something with* was Pawn in 2013.

For any inquiries, contact me through the e-mail linked to my GitHub account.
